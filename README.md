# f1-strategy-analytics

--F1 Strategy Analytics Dashboard:
The primary objective of the dashboard is to create a tool to compare how different teams
perform throughout each of the races in the season, but can also see how position changes
happen in different races and also how each team fairs in different weather conditions.
As mentioned above, there are several functions to the dashboard, the main function being
to compare how different teams perform at different tracks and to see how qualifying impacts
actual race position and see how important qualifying is in each race weekend.
To build this project, i have used python, but have used the FastF1 API, along with several
other libraries such as numpy, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn and pandas.
